# üìä Forecasting Health Service Demand

A practical course on forecasting methods for health service demand, part of the **HPDM097: Making a Difference with Health Data** module.

> üöß Note I maintain and update this repository once a year and update materials around December time.

## üìñ Overview

This repository contains hands-on materials for learning and applying forecasting techniques to healthcare data. Through six progressive computer labs, you'll master essential forecasting methods from naive benchmarks to advanced neural networks, all demonstrated with real-world health service applications.

### What You'll Learn

- Time series fundamentals and exploratory data analysis
- Naive forecasting methods and benchmark models
- Cross-validation strategies for time series
- ARIMA model development and diagnostics
- Facebook Prophet for daily/seasonal patterns
- Neural network architectures for forecasting (Keras & PyTorch)
- Best practices for model evaluation and selection

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Basic understanding of Python, pandas, and NumPy
- Familiarity with matplotlib for visualization
- Basic statistics knowledge (recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/health-data-science-OR/forecasting.git

   ```

2. **Create the conda environment**
   ```bash
   conda env create -f binder/environment.yml
   conda activate hds_forecast
   ```

3. **Launch Jupyter**
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```
